# CRUK [PyBossa](https://github.com/PyBossa/pybossa) Project Template

## Basic idea

The basic idea here is to create a project template that will allow us at CRUK to easily fork this repo to create 
new project for our PyBossa instance.

This template will eventually be designed to allow local development of projects (as in without having to run a local
copy of PyBossa, talking instead to our dev server via the pybossa.js file) and then through a jenkins process, the 
project will be able to committed to be deployed (CI).
