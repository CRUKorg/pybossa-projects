                        Our scientists need help analysing cancer cells. They have lots of questions but not enough time to look at their piles of images. So, we’d like your help. All you need to do is try to identify the cancer cells in images like the one below.

                                            Under a microscope it can be difficult to see the outline and structure of cells. Therefore, scientists add stains that stick to certain parts of the cell and make it easier to see them. One commonly used stain is haematoxylin which turns just the nucleus of cells blue. Here are some examples
                                        </h2>

                                            This is a section from the surface of the lung. The nuclei of the cells that make up the surface, epithelial cells, can be seen in blue. Specialised, hair-like structures called cilia can also just be made out. In healthy lungs, these are responsible for wafting mucus out of the lungs. The blue nuclei of white blood cells can also be seen

                                            Cancer develops when mistakes start building up in the nucleus, the control room of the cells, to the point that control over the cell is lost. The cell starts to lose many of its specialised features, stops behaving properly and starts replicating uncontrollably.
                                            You can think about it like a small, organised village with houses of similar shapes and sizes transforming into a sprawling, rapidly expanding city.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Healthy cells are strictly organised and regulated. They all have a similar shape and size and are neatly arranged. Their shape, behaviour and all interactions with their neighbours is tightly monitored and controlled.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                        <p>Cancer cells do not look like healthy cells. With loss of control and regulation the cells start to take on more varied and relaxed shapes and behaviours. Producing more cells becomes more important than creating healthy, well maintained and fully functioning cells.

                                            Our 'village' is rapidly expanding, with buildings of all shapes and sizes sprouting up wherever they find space. </p>

                                            With complete loss of control, individual cancer cells take on all kinds of strange shapes, sizes and behaviours. Eventually this turns into a sprawling mass of cells with only basic underlying infrastructure keeping the mass of cells going. It is hard to predict exactly what they will look like other than they will look disorganised, dissimilar to each other and generally chaotic

                                            Our 'village' has become an uncontrolled, varied, overcrowded city.

                                            However, a tumour consists of more than just cancer cells. There is often a lot of stringy and tough tissue called stroma. The Stromal cells provide structure and support to the cancer cells.

                                            There also tends to be a lot of small, round solid looking white blood cells (but they’ll look blue in these images) near the site of a tumour.

                                            Scientists researching cancer often want to know if a cell is storing or making a certain molecule. To answer this question they use special stains that only stick to the molecule they want to investigate. These are called immnunostains and turn parts of the cell brown wherever the specific molecule is present. Here are some examples.
                                        </h2>

                                            This stain sticks to a molecule called p53. Some of these cancer cells have got brown nuclei. This means they have p53 in their nuclei. However, some of the nuclei are still blue so not all the cells have p53 present in their nuclei.

                                            These cells have been stained for a molecule called HDAC4. We can see that the cytoplasm is has turned brown so must contain HDAC4. The nuclei are all blue so the nuclei of these cells do not contain any HDAC4. As we cannot see well defined cell membranes here (like we can with the HER2 example) so we can assume that the cell membranes also do not hold any HDAC4.

                                            This stain identifies a molecule called HER2 which is very important in breast cancer. We can see that there are cancer cells here with brown membranes indicating they are “presenting” HER2 on their cell membranes. To the right are the small blue nuclei of white blood cells that are not presenting HER2.

                        This is a healthy section of lung. The large green outline indicates an airway. This is lined by a thin layer of lung epithelial cells. These are indicated by the small green outlines and green arrows. Take a closer look.

                        These cells, are nicely defined, form a nice orderly structure and are all fairly similar to each other. Look really closely and you’ll seen fine hair like structures facing into the airway that are responsible for wafting mucus out of your lungs. This complex, organised and uniform behaviour is lost when these cells become cancerous.

                    <p>
                        Here we have lots of cancer cells that have formed loose chains and rings. We have circled four of these structures in red but you can see there are many more.

                        Cancer are normally unable to form organised shapes and complicated structures. However, sometimes cancer cells make a poor attempt to behave like healthy cells such as the tightly packed, single layer of healthy lung epithelial cells seen in the previous image. This is what you can see in this sample

                        Look closely at these cells and compare them with what you see with the previous healthy epithelial cells. The cells in this image aren’t as nicely defined, are very different to each other, tend to bunch up and occasionally break away to form clusters and lumps. This lack of good, organised and uniform cell behaviour is typical of cancer cells

                        In-between these rings and chains of cancer cells is the stroma, a small section of which is circled in purple. Also in the stroma are some clusters of white blood cells.

                    <h2>Guidance Image 3 – Cancer cells in clumps and lots of stroma mixed with blood cells</h2>

                    <p>
                        Here are more cancer cells but this time formed in clusters and clumps, most of which are circled in red.

                        Look closely at the image and look at the features that differ between the cancer cells and the surrounding stroma and blood cells

                    <h2>Guidance Image 4 – Dead cells, cancer cells in clumps, flood of stroma and lymphocytes</h2>

                    <p>
                        This image is of a very busy sample containing cancer cells, stroma and lots of small, round and solid looking blood cells

                        Look really closely inside the red circled areas and try to spot the boundary between the cancer cells and the stroma/blood cells by looking really closely at the shapes and organisation of the cells

                        The brown circle and arrow here indicates a collection of dead cells. These can be ignored

                    <h2>Guidance Image 5 – Stroma, blood cells, cartilage, healthy lung epithelia, cancer cells including examples extreme nuclear pleomorphism</h2>

                    <p>
                        In this image shows you most of the cells we have talked about.

                        The green outlines some healthy lung epithelial cells. Look at uniform and well organised they are.

                        The orange outline indicates some cartilage

                        The purple circles indicates some sections of the stroma while the pink circle indicates a cluster of white blood cells

                        The red outlines indicates some clumps of cancer cells below the healthy epithelial cells. But there are more clumps of cancer cells above and to the right of the piece of cartilage. The red arrow points to some of the cancer cells that are particularly good examples of just how odd and variable cancer cells can become.

                        Like in the previous example, try to identify the boundary between cancer cells and stroma.
